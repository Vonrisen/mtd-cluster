# Installing Monitoring and Security Tools in KubeSphere

This guide details the installation of Grafana for visualization, configuration of Prometheus data sources for your application metrics (MySQL, Frontend, Backend), and the setup of Falco for runtime security monitoring within your KubeSphere cluster.

**Prerequisites:**

* A working KubeSphere cluster deployed on your VMs (as per the previous guide).
* SSH access to your Master node.
* `kubectl` configured to interact with your cluster (usually done automatically by KubeKey on the master).
* Helm installed on your Master node.

## 1. Install Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, used to deploy applications packaged as Charts. We will use Helm to install Grafana, Prometheus Exporters, and Falco.

Follow the official Helm documentation to install the Helm binary on your Master node:

* [Official Helm Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

Once installed, verify Helm is working by checking its version:

```bash
helm version
